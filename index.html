      I have always been fascinated with technology. When I was a child, I would always be on the computer playing educational video games, practicing spelling, math, and typing. As I grew older, so did my appreciation for new technology. I would save up whatever money I would earn so I could buy myself the latest PlayStation, GameBoy, or iPod Photo (revolutionary at the time). Admittedly, my fondness for technology was mostly attributed to the entertainment value. It wasn’t until I got my first job that I realized the true value and potential.

      Right after I graduated high school, I knew that I wanted to work while I was enrolled at UCI. I submitted an application to Apple and was fortunate enough to be offered a job at one the retail locations. It was there, while working with many different people, from many different walks of life, that I developed a true understanding that technology can enrich life in a variety of ways. My role at Apple is called a “Creative,” which is essentially one of the trainers that help people use their products to foster their passions such as photography, videography, music, and coding! While immersed in this role, I see, on a daily basis, all of the different ways that people are using their technology to make their life more efficient and/or more fun (as indoctrinated as that makes me sound). Most importantly, it helped me decide which career path I want to forge forward with and pushed me to sign up for the Coding Bootcamp at UCI!
